Working with unit testing on any project that at least tries to be serious is a must, it doesn’t matter if you choose to use a TDD (test-driven development) approach or not you are going to have a lot of benefits by using it.

In this article first, we are going to shortly mention the benefits of unit testing and then we are going to create a full example of angular unit testing using jasmine and karma explaining each step of the process.

Benefits of Unit Testing
Let´s go first through what I think are the main reasons to use unit testing in your solution…

Improve the design of implementations.
Start coding a feature without giving it a lot of thought to the design is a very common mistake among developers. Using unit testing is going to enforce you to think and re-think the design, and if you are using TDD the impact is even bigger.
Allows refactoring.
Since you already have tests that ensure that everything is working as expected, you can easily add changes to that code with the certainty that you are not adding any bugs.
Add new features without breaking anything.
When you are adding a new feature you can run the tests to ensure that you ain’t breaking any other part of the application.
There are many more, but these three are already such a big win on any project that for me are deal sealers. but if you are not convinced yet let’s mention a couple more.

Tests are good documentation.
Tests make developers more confident about their work.

You can say that all their benefits come at a great cost: TIME, but this is completely false. All the time that using unit testing may cost you is going to be small compared to the time they are going to save you later when you are introducing new features or making any refactors. The time spent resolving bugs is going to be drastically smaller than if you are not using unit testing.
